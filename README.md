- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kshitizkhanal7
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in energy systems, planning, machine learning, and open knowledge.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program at the Department of City and Regional Planning at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In my dissertation, I investigate the applications of machine learning and geospatial analysis techniques in energy planning.

- I am also building [Energy in Numbers](https://energyinnumbers.com/). This is a website created as a resource for climate-conscious people interested in energy and analytics. Please check it out and let me know how you find it. I plan to continually improve it.
- My [personal website](https://kshitizkhanal.com) contains more information about my project portfolio, CV, talks, and teaching experience.
